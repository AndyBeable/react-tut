## App Flow

- User types in input
- Callback gets invovked
- We call setState with the new value
- Component rerenders
- Input it told what its value is (coming from state)

Understanding 'this' in classes
To find out what 'this' is referring to, look at where the function is being invoked. Look to the left of the dot. Eg, truck.driveMyTruck()
