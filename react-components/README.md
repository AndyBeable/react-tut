# A component is a function or a class that produces HTML to show a user (using JSX) and handles feedback from a user (event handlers)

## 3 tenants of components

- Component Nesting - a component can be shown inside of another
- Component Reusability - aim to make components that can be reused easily across our app
- Component Configuration - we should be able to configure a component when its created

Props allow us to configure how a component behaves, or the content that it shows.

Props is a system for passing data from a parent component to a child component. Props goal is to customise or configure a child component.
